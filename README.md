### Welcome to my profile. ✋
<hr /> 
<p>My name is Michał, and I am currently a Junior Automation Specialist at Lipton Manufacturing Poland. I graduated with a degree in Industrial Robotics from the Silesian University of Technology, and I've been working with robots ever since. Both in my current job and prior to this, I have always enjoyed coding. My journey began when I joined the Silesian Phoenix (AI-METH) science club, where I fell in love with the craft.</p>
<p>In my work, I apply knowledge and skills from various technology domains. Not only do I code in **Python, JavaScript, and C++**, but I also create functional **PLC** programs and design components using **SolidWorks 3D**.</p>
